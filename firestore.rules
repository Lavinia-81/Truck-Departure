/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the dispatch schedule application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read access to dispatch schedules, while restricting write access
 * to authenticated users (i.e. logged in users).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data consists of dispatch schedule documents stored in the `/dispatchSchedules` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Unauthenticated listing is enabled.
 * - Only authenticated users can create, update, or delete dispatch schedules.
 * - No schema enforcement is done in this prototype phase.

     * @deny   update: If the user is not authenticated or the document does not exist.
     * @deny   delete: If the user is not authenticated or the document does not exist.
     * @principle Allows public read access while restricting writes to authenticated users.
