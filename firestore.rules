/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the dispatch schedule application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open read and write access to dispatch schedules, suitable for a public
 * kiosk-style application where no authentication is required.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data consists of dispatch schedule documents stored in the `/dispatchSchedules` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read and write access is enabled for the `dispatchSchedules` collection.
 * - This is insecure for a production app with sensitive data, but acceptable for this
 *   prototype where the app is intended to be fully public.
